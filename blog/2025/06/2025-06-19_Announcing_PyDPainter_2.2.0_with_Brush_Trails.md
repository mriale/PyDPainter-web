* **Brush Trails (formerly "Spacing"):** The "Spacing" requestor has been renamed to **Brush Trails**. It is a rethinking of DPaint III Move requestor which allows you rotate and scale brushes along a path along with "ease-in/out" options.
* **Brush Rotation and Scaling:** You now rotate brushes with the `9` and `0` keys along with the `-` and `=` (or `+`) keys that scale while you are painting. Also, the mouse wheel now scales built-in brushes when used on the toolbar.
* **Brush Type/Size Indicator:** A new on-screen indicator helps you visualize your current brush type, rotation, and size.
* **Native File Dialogs:** A new Prefs option allows you to use the OS file dialogs.
* **Signed Windows EXE:** The Windows executable is now signed so that antivirus programs don't delete it.
* **Improved Mac Support:** Added a native Mac ARM binary .app for download. The Command key also works like CTRL for menu shortcuts and the menus have the Command symbol in them as well.
* **Clipboard Paste Support:** You can now paste text directly into the text tool.
* **Click Menus:** In addition to the click/release menu mode, they also work in a click/click mode to make it easier to use with laptops.
* **Increased Undo Levels:** Increased undo levels from 20 to 256
* **Comprehensive Documentation Updates:** New Brush Trails documentation and tutorials. Added Screen Format details as well.
